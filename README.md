## Dependencies

This server requires **Docker** to be installed and running on your system, as it is used by the [devcontainers cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) to build and manage development containers.

- [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

No other dependencies are required to use the MCP Devcontainers server.

## Usage

MCP servers are configured differently depending on the client that you are using. For reference, this is how you would configure it using Claude Desktop.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devcontainers": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@crunchloop/mcp-devcontainers"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## MCP Transport

At the moment, only `stdio` transport has been implemented.
